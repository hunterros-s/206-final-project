# 206-final-project
● Create a fully-working program without any scaffolding (starter code)
● Create and modify tables in an SQLite Database
● Utilize APIs (including researching methods)
● Utilize visualization software (including researching options)
● Document your code

Students who present their project (must have all data gathered in a database, select the
stored data, do calculations, and create visualizations) on Tuesday April 23rd (during the
last lecture) will receive 15 points of extra credit. They will still have till April 30th to
complete the report and submit the project. We have a limited number of slots for teams
to present during the last lecture.
You must submit a report on your project and a zipped copy of all of your code on
canvas by Tuesday April 30th at 11:59pm. Absolutely no late assignments will be
accepted.
Your group must attend a grading session on Zoom on April 30th or May 1st if you
don't present on April 23rd. Your group will be able to pick their first and second
choice for when they will present/answer questions. However, you may not get your
first choice.

PART 1 – Submit your plan (10 points)
Submit your plan for your final project on Canvas by 11:59 pm by April 2nd. You will
earn 2 points each for items d-h below.
a. What is your group's name?
b. Who are the people in the group (first name, last name, umich email)?
c. What APIs/websites will you be gathering data from? The base URLs for the
APIs/websites must be different for them to count as different APIs.
d. What data will you collect from each API/website and store in a database? Be
specific.
e. What data will you be calculating from the data in the database? Be specific.
f. What visualization package will you be using (Matplotlib, Plotly, Seaborn, etc)?
g. What graphs/charts will you be creating?
h. Who is responsible for what? Please note that all team members should do an
equal amount of programming and total work.
PART 2 – Gather the data and save it to a single database (100 points)
● For a two-person group you must access either two APIs or one API and one website with
BSoup (e.g. Facebook, GitHub, Gmail, Yelp, etc). For a three-person group you must
access three APIs or two APIs and one website. This is worth 10 points.
● Access and store at least 100 rows in your database from each API/website (10 points).
● For at least one API you must have two tables that share an integer key (20 points). You
must not have duplicate string data in your database! Do not just split data from
one table into two! Also, there should be only one final database!
● You must limit how much data you store from an API into the database each time you
execute the file that stores data to the database to 25 or fewer items (60 points). The data
must be stored in a SQLite database. This means that you must run the file that stores the
data multiple times to gather at least 100 items total without duplicating any data or
changing the source code.
PART 3 – Process the data (50 points) – after you have gathered all your data.
● You must select some data from all of the tables in your database and calculate
something from that data (20 points). You could calculate the count of how many items
occur on a particular day of the week or the average of the number of items per day.
● You must do at least one database join to select your data for your calculations or visualizations (20 points).
● Write out the calculated data to a file as text (10 points)

PART 4 – Visualize the data (50 points)
● If you have 2 people in your group you must create at least 2 visualizations of the
calculated data. If you have 3 people you must create at least 3 visualizations. You are
free to choose any visualization tool/software that you can create with Python code.
● You will not earn the full 50 points if your visualizations don't go beyond the examples
you were given in lecture. If you use an example from lecture, you should change
something from the example you were given in lecture, such as change the colors of the
bars in a bar chart for example.

BONUS A - Add additional API sources (Max 30 points)
● Earn up to 30 points for an additional API. You have to gather 100 items from the API
and store it in the database. You must calculate something from the data in the database.
You must write out the calculation in a file.
BONUS B - Add additional visualizations (Max 30 points)
● Earn up to 15 points for each additional visualization.
